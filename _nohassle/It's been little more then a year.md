It's been little more then a year since the store closed, and not quite a year since I got the job as a Contact Tracer. 

One thing that I've realized is that I can't go back to normal - no normal to go back to - it's gone, never to return, as if it were never there. 

Nothing but the next day, the next weekend, the next appointment, and the next family gathering. It blurs after a while, like the view from a commuter train.
