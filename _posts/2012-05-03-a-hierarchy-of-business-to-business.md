> If you're selling a product or service to a business--to a
> non-owner--consider this hierarchy, from primary needs on down:
> 
> *   Avoiding risk   
> *   Avoiding hassle   
> *   Gaining praise   
> *   Gaining power   
> *   Having fun   
> *   Making a profit
> 
> In most large organizations, nothing happens unless at least one of
> these needs are met, and in just about every organization big enough
> and profitable enough to buy from you, the order of needs starts with
> the first one and works its way down the list.
