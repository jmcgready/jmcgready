> If you hold the small end of a megaphone up to your ear, it acts as an amplifier, helping you listen more carefully.
>
> And if you want to be heard, you can move it to your mouth and share your ideas. Persistently, consistently and often.
>
> The best way to complain is to make something.  The second best way is to say something.  And if you can organize others to say it with you, even better.
