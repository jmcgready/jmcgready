## it was colder than last week, so I didn't do much...

Got a little less sleep than normal, due to the tornado warning that turned into just a windy day.

Went to my doctor's appointment, made sure I had a referral for my _other_ doctor's appointment tomorrow.

## Five Guys and UberEats

Wanted to get something special for the day, so I wound up ordering from Five Guys via UberEats 

Tracking was easy _(like Uber, you get driver info and real time location data),_ and you tipped and rated just like you would for a ride.

The burger was awesome (as always), and the regular order of fries is enough for _anyone_.

## one day more...

I can't believe I've only one more day of vacation left - I wonder how things would be if I ever took 2 weeks of vacation.

I'm not sure... and anyway I return to work in 2 days, with all the backlog that comes with my return.
