title: Now is not always
category: life

haven't posted in a while.. 

A collection of things have happened:
<br>
* a neighborhood social post gave me the motivation needed to clean up my apartment, 
which was  *(and to an extent still is)* cluttered
* I've reached a milestone at my job where retirement is both possible and improbable
* Like many others, I face a barrage of *new normals*, most of which tend to be worse than the *preceding* normals
<br>
*Remember*
*No moment is wasted.*
*Now is not always.*

<br>
Thought I'd be farther along than I am now.<br>
I see people ahead of me who once were alongside me.<br>
The alternate timelines play out in my head, strengthened by hindsight. 
<br>

*Remember*
*No moment is wasted.*
*Now is not always.*

<br>
I once had long term plans, now nothing<br>
Hammered down by  a culture of all-encompassing oblivious inattention <br>
where ADHD is the new Tetragrammaton.
<br>

*Remember*
*No moment is wasted.*
*Now is not always.*
<br>
I'm tired of it all right now
I can't see things improving
I can't see how this ends
<br>

*Remember*
*No moment is wasted.*
*Now is not always.*
