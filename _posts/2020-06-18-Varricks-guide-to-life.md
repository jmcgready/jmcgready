> In that story of yours—the fisherman watching the stars,
>  dying alone—you thought he gave up right?
>  
> But he went on living. 
> He lost everyone, but he still got up every morning. 
> He made a life, even if it was alone. 
> 
> That's the world. 
> Everything you build, it tears down.
> Everything you've got, it takes—and it's gone forever. 
> The only choices you get are to lie down and die or keep going.
>  
> He kept going.
> That's as close to beating the world as anyone gets.
