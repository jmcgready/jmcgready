#Last year
It's been a few weeks since I could last say that I worked for Penn. The normal post-employment letdown is aggravated by the very thing that brought it about - the pandemic.

Normally I would go to enough places, do enough things, and interact with enough people to make my home a welcome oasis of solitude.
