It's been a little bit *more* than a year since the store closed, and a little *less* than a year since I started working as a contact tracer.

While everyone else can talk about returning to normal, I don't have that option. 

My normal is gone. 
Long gone. 

Not only gone, but erased - as if it were never there. 

This year has been a collection of days, weekends, appointments, and family gatherings that blur like the view from the window of a commuter train. 

I'm not sure where the train's going. I'm just sitting.
